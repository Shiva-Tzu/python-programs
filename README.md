Many of these exploits and programs are designed and published with the understanding that you have the technical ability to execute them. 
This is purposeful, you should be well aware of the power of these exploits. With great power comes great responsibility... 

These are meant for white hat/ethical hacking purposes only. Any use of these exploits for illegal action is your responsibility and yours alone. 

Thank you Zaid Sabih for the excellent course that has taught me how to write these programs.
